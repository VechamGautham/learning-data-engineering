    "\n",
    "**DataOps** is a collaborative data management practice focused on improving the communication, integration, and automation of data flows between data managers and data consumers across an organization.  \n",
    "It aims to deliver **faster, more reliable, and higher-quality** data analytics through the adoption of agile development, DevOps practices, and lean manufacturing principles.\n",

    "## üèõ The Three Pillars of DataOps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automation**  \n",
    "   - Streamlines repetitive processes using tools and scripts.\n",
    "   - Enables rapid, reliable, and scalable data pipeline deployments.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Observability & Monitoring**  \n",
    "   - Ensures full visibility into the performance, health, and data quality across pipelines.\n",
    "   - Uses monitoring tools and alerts to proactively detect issues.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Incident Response**  \n",
    "   - Defines structured processes for identifying, triaging, and resolving data issues quickly.\n",
    "   - Reduces downtime and minimizes business impact.\n",

    "**DataOps Automation** is the practice of streamlining and automating every stage of a **data pipeline** ‚Äî from ingestion to transformation to delivery ‚Äî in order to:\n",
    "- Reduce manual intervention.\n",
    "- Improve reliability and consistency.\n",
    "- Enable faster and safer deployments.\n",
    "- Integrate best practices from **DevOps** into data engineering workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "It borrows concepts from **DevOps automation** like:\n",

    "## üõ† Levels of DataOps Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1Ô∏è‚É£ No Automation\n",
    "- All processes are run **manually** by engineers.\n",
    "- Time-consuming, prone to human error, and difficult to scale.\n",
