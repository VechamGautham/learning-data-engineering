    "# Cron Jobs (Before Orchestration)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Cron Logo](./images/cron.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Cron?\n",
    "**Cron** is a Unix/Linux utility (from the 1970s) that automatically runs commands or scripts on a schedule you define.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How a Cron Job Works\n",
    "A cron job line has **five timing fields** followed by the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    MINUTE(0–59) HOUR(0–23) DAY(1–31) MONTH(1–12) WEEKDAY(0–6)  command\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `*` (asterisk) to mean “any value”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "- Run at midnight on Jan 1 every year:\n",
    "\n",
    "      0 0 1 1 * echo \"Happy New Year\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run every night at midnight:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Before Orchestration: Pure Scheduling with Cron\n",
    "Teams used to chain data pipeline steps by scheduling **multiple cron jobs** a little apart in time so they’d (hopefully) run in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 12:00 AM → ingest API  \n",
    "- 01:00 AM → transform  \n",
    "- 02:00 AM → combine with DB  \n",
    "- 03:00 AM → load to warehouse\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **pure scheduling approach**—no dependency awareness, just timed starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems with Pure Cron Scheduling\n",
    "- ❌ No dependency checks (a 1 AM job runs even if the midnight job failed or ran long)  \n",
    "- ❌ Minimal monitoring/alerting; failures often discovered late  \n",
    "- ❌ Debugging & observability are DIY (logs, alerts, retries)  \n",
    "- ❌ Fragile when task durations vary\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pure Scheduling Drawbacks](./images/pure_scheduiling.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## When Cron Is Still a Good Fit\n",
    "- ✅ Simple, independent, recurring tasks (backups, log cleanup, small data fetches)  \n",
    "- ✅ Quick prototypes where a full orchestrator is overkill  \n",
    "- ✅ Environments with very light automation needs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb:** If tasks depend on other tasks finishing, or you need retries, backfills, SLAs, or rich monitoring—use an **orchestration tool** (e.g., Airflow, Prefect, Dagster). Otherwise, Cron is perfectly fine for small periodic jobs."

    "- **Late 2000s**:  \n",
    "  - **Facebook’s DataSwarm** → built internally to manage their growing data workflows.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **2010s**:  \n",
    "  - **Apache Oozie** → became popular, but it was tied to Hadoop clusters, making it less flexible in heterogeneous environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2014**:  \n",
    "  - **Airbnb released Airflow** → inspired by earlier tools like DataSwarm but designed to be **open-source, flexible, and Python-based**.  \n",
    "  - Quickly became the *industry standard*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2019**:  \n",
    "  - **Apache Airflow** graduated to a full Apache Software Foundation project, solidifying its role as the most widely adopted orchestration framework.\n",

    "# Orchestration Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Orchestration?\n",
    "Orchestration is about managing complex **data pipelines** more reliably than simple Cron jobs. While Cron can schedule tasks, orchestration tools give you advanced control over dependencies, monitoring, alerts, and fallback plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Set up dependencies between tasks  \n",
    "- Monitor task execution  \n",
    "- Get alerts on failures  \n",
    "- Create fallback plans  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Adds more operational overhead compared to simple Cron scheduling  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Pros and Cons](./images/pro_con.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)\n",
    "At the heart of orchestration is the **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** — a structure where:\n",
    "- Each **task** is a node  \n",
    "- Each **arrow** (edge) shows data flow  \n",
    "- Data flows **only in one direction**  \n",
    "- No loops or cycles are allowed  \n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures predictable execution order.\n",
    "\n",
    "![DAG](./images/dag.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies Between Tasks\n",
    "With Cron, tasks could overlap or break if one runs late.  \n",
    "With orchestration, you can **define dependencies**: a task won’t start until its upstream tasks are complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Task Dependencies](./images/task_based.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Orchestration in Airflow\n",
    "In Airflow, DAGs are defined in Python. You programmatically specify tasks and how they depend on each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Code Example](./images/code_for_orchestration_.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Airflow then lets you:\n",
    "- Visualize DAGs  \n",
    "- Trigger runs manually or on schedule  \n",
    "- Monitor progress & debug issues  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time-based vs Event-based Triggers\n",
    "Airflow DAGs can run on **time-based schedules** (like Cron) or be triggered by **events** (like new data arriving).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Time or Event Based](./images/time_or_event_based.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Time-based\n",
    "Run daily at midnight:  \n",
    "![Example Time-based](./images/eg_time_based.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Event-based\n",
    "Run when a dataset updates:  \n",
    "![Example Event-based](./images/eg_event_based.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even make **part of a DAG** wait for an external event, e.g., a file landing in S3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![External Flow](./images/external_flow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Quality Checks\n",
    "Another orchestration benefit: embedding **data quality checks** into the DAG.  \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Count of null values  \n",
    "- Validating ranges of values  \n",
    "- Schema verification  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Quality Checks](./images/quality_checks.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Orchestration tools (like Airflow) provide the structure to:\n",
    "- Define pipelines as **DAGs**  \n",
    "- Manage **dependencies** between tasks  \n",
    "- Run on **time or event conditions**  \n",
    "- Monitor and alert on failures  \n",
    "- Enforce **data quality**  \n",

    "# Airflow Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Airflow is built around a set of core components that work together to run your DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), monitor dependencies, execute tasks, and display status updates to users.\n",

    "- **Scheduler** → Monitors DAGs and determines when tasks should run.  \n",
    "- **Workers** → Execute the tasks that are scheduled.  \n",
    "- **Metadata Database** → Stores the state of DAGs and tasks (success, failure, etc.).  \n",

    "  - If a task’s dependencies are complete (dependency-based)  \n",
    "- Once ready, the **Scheduler**:\n",
    "  1. Pushes tasks into a queue  \n",
    "  2. Uses an **Executor** to extract tasks from the queue  \n",
    "  3. Sends the tasks to **Workers**, which run them  \n",

    "## 📊 Task Status and Metadata Database\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Scheduler** and **Workers** update the **Metadata Database** with task status and DAG states.  \n",
    "- The **Web Server** then queries the metadata database to extract these statuses.  \n",
    "- Finally, the **UI** displays task states to the user.  \n",

    "\n",
    "## Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keep tasks simple & atomic**  \n",
    "  Each task should do one thing (e.g., Extract → Transform → Load).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoid top-level code**  \n",
    "  Only define DAGs and operators in the DAG file.  \n",
    "  Scheduler parses DAGs ~every 30s, so heavy code here is inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use variables instead of hardcoding**  \n",
    "  - Airflow Variables / environment variables for configs  \n",
    "  - Built-in macros like `{{ ds }}` for logical date\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Task Groups for readability**  \n",
    "  Group related tasks in the UI for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Airflow is an orchestrator, not an executor**  \n",
    "  Heavy data processing should run in Spark, BigQuery, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Don’t use XComs for large data**  \n",
    "  Pass references (e.g., file paths, IDs), not entire DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keep extra code separate**  \n",
    "  Import reusable logic from external Python modules."

    "# TaskFlow API in Airflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why TaskFlow API?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, when writing DAGs in Airflow, we had to:\n",
    "- Manually instantiate a DAG object.\n",
    "- Use operators like `PythonOperator` for Python tasks.\n",
    "- Keep track of multiple names (task_id, Python function name, and task variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "This often made DAGs **verbose** and harder to maintain for Python-heavy workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **TaskFlow API** (introduced in Airflow 2.0):\n",
    "- DAGs are **easier to write** and **more concise**.\n",
    "- We use **decorators** (`@dag` and `@task`) instead of explicitly writing operators.\n",
    "- We reduce the number of names we must manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Traditional Paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "In the traditional approach:\n",
    "1. Instantiate a `DAG` object with parameters.\n",
    "2. Define tasks with `PythonOperator`.\n",
    "3. Explicitly set dependencies using the `>>` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Traditional Approach](./images/traditional_approach.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you must:\n",
    "- Track `task_id`, function names, and task variables.\n",
    "- Write extra boilerplate code for each Python task.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## TaskFlow API\n",
    "\n",
    "With **TaskFlow API**:\n",
    "1. Use `@dag` decorator to define the DAG.\n",
    "2. Use `@task` decorator for Python functions (they implicitly become tasks).\n",
    "3. Define dependencies simply by calling functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![TaskFlow API](./images/taskflow_api.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **function name automatically becomes `task_id`**.\n",
    "- `@task` implicitly calls `PythonOperator`.\n",
    "- Code is **shorter and cleaner**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Dependencies\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![TaskFlow API Dependencies](./images/taskflow_api_2.png)\n",

    "## XCom with Traditional Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, if you wanted tasks to share data, you had to:\n",
    "- Push values into XCom (`xcom_push`).\n",
    "- Pull values from XCom in another task (`xcom_pull`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Traditional XCom](./images/traditional_xcom.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## XCom with TaskFlow API\n",
    "\n",
    "With TaskFlow API, you just use `return` in one task and parameters in another:\n",
    "- Returning a value automatically pushes it into XCom.\n",
    "- Passing arguments automatically pulls it from XCom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![TaskFlow XCom](./images/taskflow_xcom.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes **data passing very natural**, like calling Python functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use TaskFlow API?\n",
    "\n",
    "- When most tasks are **Python functions**.\n",
    "- When you want **simpler, cleaner DAG code**.\n",
    "- When you need to **pass data between tasks** often (XCom via `return` and arguments is much easier).\n",
    "- For new DAGs (recommended by Airflow community).\n",
    "\n",
    "But remember:\n",
    "- TaskFlow API is **not a replacement**. Some operators (like `SqlToS3Operator`, `BashOperator`, etc.) are still needed.\n",
    "- You can **combine TaskFlow API with Traditional operators** in the same DAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative Approach\n",
