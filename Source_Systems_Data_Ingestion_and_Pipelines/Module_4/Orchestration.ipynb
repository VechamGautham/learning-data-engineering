    "**Cron** is a Unix/Linux utility (from the 1970s) that automatically runs commands or scripts on a schedule you define.\n",

    "\n",
    "## How a Cron Job Works\n",
    "A cron job line has **five timing fields** followed by the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    MINUTE(0‚Äì59) HOUR(0‚Äì23) DAY(1‚Äì31) MONTH(1‚Äì12) WEEKDAY(0‚Äì6)  command\n",

    "**Examples**\n",
    "- Run at midnight on Jan 1 every year:\n",

    "## Before Orchestration: Pure Scheduling with Cron\n",
    "Teams used to chain data pipeline steps by scheduling **multiple cron jobs** a little apart in time so they‚Äôd (hopefully) run in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 12:00 AM ‚Üí ingest API  \n",
    "- 01:00 AM ‚Üí transform  \n",
    "- 02:00 AM ‚Üí combine with DB  \n",
    "- 03:00 AM ‚Üí load to warehouse\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **pure scheduling approach**‚Äîno dependency awareness, just timed starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems with Pure Cron Scheduling\n",
    "- ‚ùå No dependency checks (a 1 AM job runs even if the midnight job failed or ran long)  \n",
    "- ‚ùå Minimal monitoring/alerting; failures often discovered late  \n",
    "- ‚ùå Debugging & observability are DIY (logs, alerts, retries)  \n",
    "- ‚ùå Fragile when task durations vary\n",

    "## When Cron Is Still a Good Fit\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Simple, independent, recurring tasks (backups, log cleanup, small data fetches)  \n",
    "- ‚úÖ Quick prototypes where a full orchestrator is overkill  \n",
    "- ‚úÖ Environments with very light automation needs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb:** If tasks depend on other tasks finishing, or you need retries, backfills, SLAs, or rich monitoring‚Äîuse an **orchestration tool** (e.g., Airflow, Prefect, Dagster). Otherwise, Cron is perfectly fine for small periodic jobs."

    "# Orchestration Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Orchestration?\n",
    "Orchestration is about managing complex **data pipelines** more reliably than simple Cron jobs. While Cron can schedule tasks, orchestration tools give you advanced control over dependencies, monitoring, alerts, and fallback plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Set up dependencies between tasks  \n",
    "- Monitor task execution  \n",
    "- Get alerts on failures  \n",
    "- Create fallback plans  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Adds more operational overhead compared to simple Cron scheduling  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Pros and Cons](./images/pro_con.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)\n",
    "At the heart of orchestration is the **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** ‚Äî a structure where:\n",
    "- Each **task** is a node  \n",
    "- Each **arrow** (edge) shows data flow  \n",
    "- Data flows **only in one direction**  \n",
    "- No loops or cycles are allowed  \n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures predictable execution order.\n",
    "\n",
    "![DAG](./images/dag.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies Between Tasks\n",
    "With Cron, tasks could overlap or break if one runs late.  \n",
    "With orchestration, you can **define dependencies**: a task won‚Äôt start until its upstream tasks are complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Task Dependencies](./images/task_based.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Orchestration in Airflow\n",
    "In Airflow, DAGs are defined in Python. You programmatically specify tasks and how they depend on each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Code Example](./images/code_for_orchestration_.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Airflow then lets you:\n",
    "- Visualize DAGs  \n",
    "- Trigger runs manually or on schedule  \n",
    "- Monitor progress & debug issues  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time-based vs Event-based Triggers\n",
    "Airflow DAGs can run on **time-based schedules** (like Cron) or be triggered by **events** (like new data arriving).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Time or Event Based](./images/time_or_event_based.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Time-based\n",
    "Run daily at midnight:  \n",
    "![Example Time-based](./images/eg_time_based.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Event-based\n",
    "Run when a dataset updates:  \n",
    "![Example Event-based](./images/eg_event_based.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even make **part of a DAG** wait for an external event, e.g., a file landing in S3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![External Flow](./images/external_flow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Quality Checks\n",
    "Another orchestration benefit: embedding **data quality checks** into the DAG.  \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Count of null values  \n",
    "- Validating ranges of values  \n",
    "- Schema verification  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Quality Checks](./images/quality_checks.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Orchestration tools (like Airflow) provide the structure to:\n",
    "- Define pipelines as **DAGs**  \n",
    "- Manage **dependencies** between tasks  \n",
    "- Run on **time or event conditions**  \n",
    "- Monitor and alert on failures  \n",
