    "# Cron Jobs (Before Orchestration)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Cron Logo](./images/cron.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Cron?\n",
    "**Cron** is a Unix/Linux utility (from the 1970s) that automatically runs commands or scripts on a schedule you define.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How a Cron Job Works\n",
    "A cron job line has **five timing fields** followed by the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    MINUTE(0‚Äì59) HOUR(0‚Äì23) DAY(1‚Äì31) MONTH(1‚Äì12) WEEKDAY(0‚Äì6)  command\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `*` (asterisk) to mean ‚Äúany value‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "- Run at midnight on Jan 1 every year:\n",
    "\n",
    "      0 0 1 1 * echo \"Happy New Year\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run every night at midnight:\n",

    "## Before Orchestration: Pure Scheduling with Cron\n",
    "Teams used to chain data pipeline steps by scheduling **multiple cron jobs** a little apart in time so they‚Äôd (hopefully) run in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 12:00 AM ‚Üí ingest API  \n",
    "- 01:00 AM ‚Üí transform  \n",
    "- 02:00 AM ‚Üí combine with DB  \n",
    "- 03:00 AM ‚Üí load to warehouse\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **pure scheduling approach**‚Äîno dependency awareness, just timed starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems with Pure Cron Scheduling\n",
    "- ‚ùå No dependency checks (a 1 AM job runs even if the midnight job failed or ran long)  \n",
    "- ‚ùå Minimal monitoring/alerting; failures often discovered late  \n",
    "- ‚ùå Debugging & observability are DIY (logs, alerts, retries)  \n",
    "- ‚ùå Fragile when task durations vary\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pure Scheduling Drawbacks](./images/pure_scheduiling.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## When Cron Is Still a Good Fit\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Simple, independent, recurring tasks (backups, log cleanup, small data fetches)  \n",
    "- ‚úÖ Quick prototypes where a full orchestrator is overkill  \n",
    "- ‚úÖ Environments with very light automation needs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb:** If tasks depend on other tasks finishing, or you need retries, backfills, SLAs, or rich monitoring‚Äîuse an **orchestration tool** (e.g., Airflow, Prefect, Dagster). Otherwise, Cron is perfectly fine for small periodic jobs."

    "Orchestration is the backbone of modern data engineering, ensuring that complex workflows run in sequence, on time, and with reliability. Let‚Äôs walk through its evolution and see how the tooling landscape has shifted over the years.\n",
