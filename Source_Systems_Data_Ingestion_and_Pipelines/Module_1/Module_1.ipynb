    "### üì¶ One Big Table (OBT) Approach\n",

    "The **One Big Table** approach stores all information ‚Äî customer, product, order ‚Äî in one single massive table. While it may look simple, it leads to **serious problems** like:\n",

    "\n",
    "![One Big Table with Inconsistency](./images/inconsistancey_rd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the table above, the same customer ‚ÄúJane Doe‚Äù has inconsistent addresses across rows. Similarly, the product SKU ‚Äúw31‚Äù is suddenly changed to ‚Äúw40‚Äù in one row, which can lead to reporting and transactional issues.\n",

    "\n",
    "- ‚úÖ No duplicate data  \n",

    "# AWS Network Security Controls: VPC, Network ACLs, and Security Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll cover how AWS network security works using VPCs, subnets, Network ACLs, and Security Groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS networking security is built on these layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** isolated virtual network in AWS\n",
    "- **Subnets:** smaller segments within your VPC\n",
    "- **Network ACLs:** subnet-level stateless firewalls\n",
    "- **Security Groups:** instance-level stateful firewalls\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## üó∫Ô∏è What is a VPC?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Virtual Private Cloud is a logically isolated network you create in AWS.\n",
    "- It functions like your own private datacenter.\n",
    "- VPC is not a firewall, but it defines boundaries within which other security controls work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key role:** Creates an isolated environment for AWS resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üåê Subnets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subnets split your VPC into smaller networks.\n",
    "- Types:\n",
    "    - **Public Subnets:** have Internet access through an Internet Gateway\n",
    "    - **Private Subnets:** have no direct Internet access\n",
    "- Every EC2 instance is launched inside a subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîë Network ACLs (Access Control Lists)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Acts as a firewall at the subnet level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stateless:** You must configure both inbound and outbound rules separately\n",
    "- Can allow or deny traffic\n",
    "- Rules are processed in number order (lowest first)\n",
    "- Applies to all resources within a subnet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Controls:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inbound rules: control traffic into the subnet\n",
    "- Outbound rules: control traffic out of the subnet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default behavior:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inbound: Allow all\n",
    "- Outbound: Allow all\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: NACLs impact internal subnet-to-subnet traffic too._\n",
    "\n",
    "## üõ°Ô∏è Security Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "- Act as firewalls at the instance (resource) level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stateful:** Responses are automatically allowed\n",
    "- Only allow traffic, no explicit deny rules\n",
    "- Applied to individual resources\n",
    "- All rules evaluated together\n",
    "\n",
    "**Controls:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inbound: controls who can connect to the instance\n",
    "- Outbound: controls where the instance can connect\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default behavior:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inbound: Deny all\n",
    "- Outbound: Allow all\n",

    "## üìù Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Security Groups to tightly control instance-level traffic (for example, allow only port 22 for SSH)\n",
    "- Use Network ACLs for broader subnet-level controls (such as blocking IP ranges)\n",
    "- NACLs filter traffic at the subnet border\n",
    "- Security Groups filter at the resource level\n",
