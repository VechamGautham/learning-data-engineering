    "##  Source Systems for Data Ingestion\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data engineer, one of the core responsibilities is to extract **raw data** from different source systems. This raw data can be **structured**, **semi-structured**, or **unstructured**, and needs to be ingested and processed downstream.\n",

    "### üß± Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **three main categories** of data based on structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structured Data**:  \n",
    "  Data organized as tables of rows and columns.  \n",
    "  *Example*: SQL tables, CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semi-Structured Data**:  \n",
    "  Data not in strict tabular form but still containing structure like tags or keys.  \n",
    "  *Example*: JSON, XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unstructured Data**:  \n",
    "  Data with no predefined structure.  \n",
    "  *Example*: Text, audio, video, images.\n",

    "### üîë Example: Semi-Structured Data (JSON Format)\n",
    "\n",
    "A common example of semi-structured data is **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**, which stores information as a collection of key-value pairs. These can also be **nested**, allowing complex data structures.\n",

    "\n",
    "Depending on the structure, data can be stored in various mediums:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structured / Semi-Structured**: Stored in relational or NoSQL databases.\n",
    "- **Unstructured**: Stored as files (text, images, audio, etc.).\n",
    "- **Streaming**: Real-time events from producers like sensors or logs.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Relational Databases (SQL)**:  \n",
    "  Store data in fixed tables (rows and columns). Best for structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)**:  \n",
    "  Store data in key-value pairs or documents. Good for semi-structured or nested data.\n",
