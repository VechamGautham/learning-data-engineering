    "\n",
    "In data engineering, how you **structure your data** plays a critical role in ensuring **data integrity, efficiency, and scalability**. Let's explore the two most common approaches to storing data in a tabular format:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üì¶ One Big Table (OBT) Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The **One Big Table** approach stores all information ‚Äî customer, product, order ‚Äî in one single massive table. While it may look simple, it leads to **serious problems** like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- üîÅ **Redundancy**: The same customer/product info is repeated across multiple rows.  \n",
    "- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Inconsistency**: If a customer or product info changes, you have to manually update **every** row ‚Äî or risk inconsistencies.  \n",
    "- üê¢ **Slow Updates**: Updates require full-table scans and can cause performance bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "![One Big Table with Inconsistency](./images/inconsistancey_rd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the table above, the same customer ‚ÄúJane Doe‚Äù has inconsistent addresses across rows. Similarly, the product SKU ‚Äúw31‚Äù is suddenly changed to ‚Äúw40‚Äù in one row, which can lead to reporting and transactional issues.\n",

    "Instead of putting everything in one table, **relational databases** split the data into **multiple related tables** using **primary keys** and **foreign keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚úÖ No duplicate data  \n",
    "- ‚úÖ Easier updates and maintenance  \n",
    "- ‚úÖ Ensures **data integrity**  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Primary Key**: A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each record in a table.  \n",
    "- **Foreign Key**: A reference to a primary key in another table, establishing relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how a relational schema looks for an e-commerce platform:\n",
