    "\n",
    "In data engineering, how you **structure your data** plays a critical role in ensuring **data integrity, efficiency, and scalability**. Let's explore the two most common approaches to storing data in a tabular format:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 One Big Table (OBT) Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The **One Big Table** approach stores all information — customer, product, order — in one single massive table. While it may look simple, it leads to **serious problems** like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔁 **Redundancy**: The same customer/product info is repeated across multiple rows.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ **Inconsistency**: If a customer or product info changes, you have to manually update **every** row — or risk inconsistencies.  \n",
    "- 🐢 **Slow Updates**: Updates require full-table scans and can cause performance bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "![One Big Table with Inconsistency](./images/inconsistancey_rd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the table above, the same customer “Jane Doe” has inconsistent addresses across rows. Similarly, the product SKU “w31” is suddenly changed to “w40” in one row, which can lead to reporting and transactional issues.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧱 Relational Database Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of putting everything in one table, **relational databases** split the data into **multiple related tables** using **primary keys** and **foreign keys**.\n",

    "\n",
    "- ✅ No duplicate data  \n",
    "- ✅ Easier updates and maintenance  \n",
    "- ✅ Ensures **data integrity**  \n",
    "- ✅ Follows a **database schema** (predefined structure)\n",

    "- **Primary Key**: A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each record in a table.  \n",
    "- **Foreign Key**: A reference to a primary key in another table, establishing relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how a relational schema looks for an e-commerce platform:\n",

    "### ⚛️ 1. Atomicity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**: All operations in a transaction must succeed or none should happen.  \n",
    "If one part fails, the whole transaction is rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "A user tries to place an online order:\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 3. Isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**: Transactions happen independently. Even if two people order something at the same time, the database will treat them **one after another** to avoid conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "- User A adds a product to cart and places an order  \n",
    "- At the exact same time, User B also places an order for the same item  \n",
    "Even if they both acted simultaneously, the database ensures proper stock adjustment without mixing the transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💾 4. Durability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**: Once a transaction is complete, it’s **saved forever**, even if there's a system crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "A payment is successful and the order is confirmed.  \n",

    "### What is **kwargs?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `**kwargs` allows passing a dictionary of named arguments to a function.\n",
    "- It unpacks dictionary keys and values into separate named parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function(**kwargs):  \n",
    "    print(kwargs)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function(name=\"Alice\", age=30)  \n",
    "# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}\n",
    "```\n",
    "🧠 It’s like saying: “I don’t know how many named arguments I’ll get, just pass them all!”\n",

    "## 🧑‍💻 Parameters vs Arguments vs Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parameter: A variable in a function definition.\n",
    "- Argument: Actual value passed to that function.\n",
    "- Keyword Argument: Argument passed with a name (e.g., name='Alice')\n",
    "- Attributes: Variables belonging to an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:  \n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):        # name & age = parameters  \n",
    "        self.name = name                  # name = attribute  \n",

    "\n",
    "- Object = Coffee Machine  \n",
    "- Attributes = Temperature, Size  \n",
    "- Parameter = brew(coffee_type='espresso')  \n",
    "- When you run the function, the coffee_type parameter decides how the internal attributes are used.\n",
