    "\n",
    "In data engineering, how you **structure your data** plays a critical role in ensuring **data integrity, efficiency, and scalability**. Let's explore the two most common approaches to storing data in a tabular format:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 One Big Table (OBT) Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The **One Big Table** approach stores all information — customer, product, order — in one single massive table. While it may look simple, it leads to **serious problems** like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔁 **Redundancy**: The same customer/product info is repeated across multiple rows.  \n",
    "- ⚠️ **Inconsistency**: If a customer or product info changes, you have to manually update **every** row — or risk inconsistencies.  \n",
    "- 🐢 **Slow Updates**: Updates require full-table scans and can cause performance bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "![One Big Table with Inconsistency](./images/inconsistancey_rd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the table above, the same customer “Jane Doe” has inconsistent addresses across rows. Similarly, the product SKU “w31” is suddenly changed to “w40” in one row, which can lead to reporting and transactional issues.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧱 Relational Database Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of putting everything in one table, **relational databases** split the data into **multiple related tables** using **primary keys** and **foreign keys**.\n",

    "\n",
    "- ✅ No duplicate data  \n",
    "- ✅ Easier updates and maintenance  \n",
    "- ✅ Ensures **data integrity**  \n",
    "- ✅ Follows a **database schema** (predefined structure)\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔐 Primary Keys and Foreign Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Key**: A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each record in a table.  \n",
    "- **Foreign Key**: A reference to a primary key in another table, establishing relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how a relational schema looks for an e-commerce platform:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Customers` table → info about each customer  \n",

    "As data became more complex and unstructured (like logs, clicks, social media posts, etc.), relational databases started showing limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Difficult to scale out horizontally (across many servers)\n",
    "- Required fixed schemas\n",
    "- Slower for huge data writes and reads\n",

    "\n",
    "**Meaning**: All operations in a transaction must succeed or none should happen.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",

    "- User A adds a product to cart and places an order  \n",
    "- At the exact same time, User B also places an order for the same item  \n",
    "Even if they both acted simultaneously, the database ensures proper stock adjustment without mixing the transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💾 4. Durability\n",

    "**Meaning**: Once a transaction is complete, it’s **saved forever**, even if there's a system crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "A payment is successful and the order is confirmed.  \n",

    "Streaming systems revolve around **three key ideas**: **Event**, **Message**, and **Stream**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **Event** is anything that happens in the world — for example, a user clicking on a link, or a temperature sensor recording a value. It's a change in the state of a system that we care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Message** is a record of that event. It contains:\n",
    "  - **Event Details** (what happened)\n",
    "  - **Event Metadata** (extra info like user ID or device type)\n",
    "  - **Timestamp** (when it happened)\n",

    "- A **Stream** is just a continuous sequence of such messages — think of it as an ongoing pipeline of data.\n",

    "In a typical streaming system:\n",
    "- The **Event Producer** emits events (this could be an app, sensor, service, etc.).\n",
    "- These events are picked up by a **Streaming Broker** (like Kafka), which acts as an **event router**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The broker does two important things:\n",
    "1. **Acts as a buffer** — it collects and holds messages briefly so they don’t overwhelm consumers.\n",
    "2. **Decouples producers and consumers** — they don’t need to interact directly or work at the same pace.\n",

    "- Consumers take messages one at a time asynchronously.\n",
    "- It's useful when **guaranteed delivery and strict order** are important.\n",

    "# AWS Network Security Controls: VPC, Network ACLs, and Security Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll cover how AWS network security works using VPCs, subnets, Network ACLs, and Security Groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS networking security is built on these layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** isolated virtual network in AWS\n",
    "- **Subnets:** smaller segments within your VPC\n",
    "- **Network ACLs:** subnet-level stateless firewalls\n",
    "- **Security Groups:** instance-level stateful firewalls\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗺️ What is a VPC?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Virtual Private Cloud is a logically isolated network you create in AWS.\n",
    "- It functions like your own private datacenter.\n",
    "- VPC is not a firewall, but it defines boundaries within which other security controls work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key role:** Creates an isolated environment for AWS resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌐 Subnets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subnets split your VPC into smaller networks.\n",
    "- Types:\n",
    "    - **Public Subnets:** have Internet access through an Internet Gateway\n",
    "    - **Private Subnets:** have no direct Internet access\n",
    "- Every EC2 instance is launched inside a subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔑 Network ACLs (Access Control Lists)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Acts as a firewall at the subnet level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stateless:** You must configure both inbound and outbound rules separately\n",
    "- Can allow or deny traffic\n",
    "- Rules are processed in number order (lowest first)\n",
    "- Applies to all resources within a subnet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Controls:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inbound rules: control traffic into the subnet\n",
    "- Outbound rules: control traffic out of the subnet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default behavior:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inbound: Allow all\n",
    "- Outbound: Allow all\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: NACLs impact internal subnet-to-subnet traffic too._\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛡️ Security Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "- Act as firewalls at the instance (resource) level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stateful:** Responses are automatically allowed\n",
    "- Only allow traffic, no explicit deny rules\n",
    "- Applied to individual resources\n",
    "- All rules evaluated together\n",
    "\n",
    "**Controls:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inbound: controls who can connect to the instance\n",
    "- Outbound: controls where the instance can connect\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default behavior:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inbound: Deny all\n",
    "- Outbound: Allow all\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Summary Table\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | VPC | Network ACLs | Security Groups |\n",
    "| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n",
    "| Level | Network boundary | Subnet level | Instance level |\n",
    "| Stateful | N/A | No (Stateless) | Yes (Stateful) |\n",
    "| Allow/Deny | N/A | Allow and Deny | Allow only |\n",
    "| Affects | All resources | All traffic in/out | Only attached resources |\n",
    "| Default Inbound | N/A | Allow all | Deny all |\n",
    "| Default Outbound | N/A | Allow all | Allow all |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Security Groups to tightly control instance-level traffic (for example, allow only port 22 for SSH)\n",
    "- Use Network ACLs for broader subnet-level controls (such as blocking IP ranges)\n",
    "- NACLs filter traffic at the subnet border\n",
    "- Security Groups filter at the resource level\n",
    "\n",
    "Your AWS networks can now be both accessible and secure!\n",
