    "### 🧠 How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You send streaming data to Firehose.\n",
    "2. It buffers and transforms data (if needed).\n",
    "3. Then delivers to destination — no code required.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔁 Firehose Buffer Size\n",
    "\n",
    "- Buffer by **size** (1–128 MB) or **time** (60–900 seconds)\n",
    "- Example: If buffer is 5MB or 60 seconds, it delivers whichever comes first.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Use **Kafka APIs** if you're already familiar with Kafka\n",
    "- Suitable for **complex event-driven architectures**\n",
    "- Offers more **customization and flexibility** than Kinesis\n",

    "\n",
    "- All these services integrate well with **CloudWatch** for monitoring.\n",
    "- You can trigger **Lambda** directly from Kinesis Streams for real-time reactions.\n",
    "- For very low-latency, **Kinesis Streams + Lambda** is a common pairing.\n",
    "- For hands-off delivery, go with **Kinesis Firehose**.\n",
