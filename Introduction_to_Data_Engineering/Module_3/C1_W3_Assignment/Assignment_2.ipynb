    "# üìò Week 3 Assignment Summary ‚Äì Scalable & Secure Web Application on AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "üõ†Ô∏è **Note:** All necessary AWS resources and configurations (EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling Group, Security Groups, Launch Templates, and S3 buckets) were **pre-provisioned** in the assignment lab environment. Our role was to observe, validate behavior under load, and make targeted changes around **security (ports), cost, and scaling**.\n",

    "## üìä Architectural Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This week‚Äôs setup implements a **3-tier architecture**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Tier**: Amazon S3 bucket holding the star schema output from the ETL pipeline  \n",
    "- **Logic Tier**: Auto Scaling Group of EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer  \n",
    "- **Presentation Tier**: A simple HTML dashboard displaying which EC2 instance served the request  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Architectural Diagram](../images/archi_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this assignment is to explore and implement a scalable, secure, and reliable web application architecture using AWS cloud services. The goal is to simulate how a real-world data application would serve analytical insights or dashboards to clients across the internet. This setup is designed to respond to client requests dynamically, with a focus on evaluating system behavior under varying loads, enforcing proper security, and improving cost efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user opens the website in their browser, an **HTTP request** is sent to the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** ‚Äî the central point that handles all incoming client traffic. The ALB then forwards the request to one of the **EC2 instances** in the **Auto Scaling Group**, based on load and availability. That EC2 instance processes the request, queries the transformed data stored in **Amazon S3**, and renders the output. The response is then sent back through the ALB to the user's browser over **port 80**, completing the round trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture aligns with the **AWS Well-Architected Framework** by ensuring:\n",
    "- üîê Secure access through restricted ports (only HTTP on port 80 is allowed),\n",
    "- ‚öôÔ∏è Reliable delivery using instances spread across **multiple Availability Zones**,\n",
    "- üìà Scalability through **Auto Scaling policies** triggered by request load,\n",
    "- üí∞ Cost efficiency via instance type optimization (e.g., switching to `t3.nano`).\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing this design in action, we gain hands-on experience with cloud-native practices essential for deploying modern data-driven applications.\n",

    "We simulated user traffic using **Apache Benchmark (ab)** and used **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CPU Utilization  \n",
    "- Network In/Out  \n",
    "- Auto Scaling Events  \n",

    "## üîê Security Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the ALB security group allowed traffic from **all IPs on *all* ports**, including a nonstandard **port 90** that exposed content we did not intend to make public.\n",
    "\n",
    "To remediate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removed the overly permissive rule (`All traffic`, `0.0.0.0/0`).  \n",
    "- Added a rule allowing only **HTTP on port 80** from the internet (`0.0.0.0/0`).  \n",
    "- (Optional best practice) Add HTTPS:443 later when TLS certs available.  \n",
    "- Validated that traffic to **port 90** (and all other ports) was now **blocked**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Security Diagram](../images/security.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîê Steps We Took to Lock Down Ports (Assignment Walkthrough)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Exposure** ‚Äì Opened the ALB DNS URL with `:90` appended; page loaded ‚Üí unintended access confirmed.  \n",
    "2. **Review Security Group Rules** ‚Äì Saw inbound `All traffic` from `0.0.0.0/0` attached to the ALB.  \n",
    "3. **Remove Insecure Rule** ‚Äì Deleted the open rule.  \n",
    "4. **Add Least-Privilege Rule** ‚Äì Created inbound rule: `HTTP | TCP 80 | 0.0.0.0/0`.  \n",
    "5. **(Optional) Restrict Admin Ports** ‚Äì If an internal admin port is needed, allow **only your IP / corporate CIDR**.  \n",
    "6. **Test Closure** ‚Äì Retry ALB DNS URL with `:90` ‚Üí connection refused / timed out (expected).  \n",
    "7. **Re-test Normal Access** ‚Äì Plain `http://<ALB-DNS-Name>` still loaded web app over port 80.  \n",
    "8. **Document Change** ‚Äì Captured screenshots + justification for security audit.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìö **Need a refresher on what a *port* is?** See: [What is a Port? (MDN)][mdn-port] ‚Ä¢ [IANA Service & Port Number Registry][iana-ports]\n",

    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Reliability via Availability Zones\n",
    "\n",
    "The application was deployed across **multiple Availability Zones (AZs)** using Auto Scaling Groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each EC2 instance had a different internal IP and AZ.  \n",
    "- Refreshing the page showed responses from different instances/AZs.  \n",
    "- Results: **High availability** and **fault tolerance** if one AZ has issues.\n",

    "\n",
    "## üí∏ Cost Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Switched instance type from **t3.micro** to **t3.nano** in a new Launch Template version.  \n",
    "- Updated the Auto Scaling Group to use the new template.  \n",
    "- Terminated existing instances so the ASG launched right-sized ones.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome: Reduced compute cost while sustaining the assignment‚Äôs demo load.\n",

    "## üìà Scalability via Dynamic Auto Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a dynamic scaling policy using the following settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target metric**: ALB request count per target = 60  \n",
    "- **Instance warm-up time**: 60 seconds  \n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If traffic spikes (example: 180 req/sec on 2 instances ‚Üí 90 each), scaling triggers.  \n",
    "- A new EC2 instance is launched.  \n",
    "- Warm-up lets the instance initialize before being counted by scaling metrics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This filters noise and reduces ‚Äúthrash scaling.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "We stress-tested with **1M Apache Benchmark requests** and observed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additional EC2 instances launching.  \n",
    "- Higher CPU + network usage in CloudWatch.  \n",
    "- ASG scaling out, then (when load subsided) eligible to scale in.\n",
    "\n",
