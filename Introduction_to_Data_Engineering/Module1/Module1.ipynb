    "\n",
    "From the video, I understood that data has always existed — not just in the form of numbers or words, but also as natural signals like wind, sound, or light. But the kind of data we focus on in data engineering is **digitally recorded data**, the type that can be stored on a computer and used for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Early Days (1960s–1980s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data engineering didn’t start as a formal role. In the 1960s, computers introduced the first **digital databases**. In the 1970s, IBM engineers created **relational databases** and **SQL** (Structured Query Language), which is still widely used today.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1980s, **Bill Inmon** came up with the idea of the **data warehouse**, which helped businesses transform and organize data for better decision-making. These early efforts laid the foundation for what would eventually become the field of data engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The 1990s: Growth of BI and the Internet\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1990s, companies began building **data pipelines** to support **Business Intelligence (BI)** and reporting. Two important names during this time were **Bill Inmon** and **Ralph Kimball**, who proposed different approaches to data modeling for analytics.\n",

    "## The 2000s: Big Data Era Begins\n",

    "Here’s what stood out:\n",
    "- **Big Data** was defined by the 3 V's: **Volume**, **Velocity**, and **Variety**.\n",
    "- In **2004**, Google released the **MapReduce** paper, which introduced a new way to process huge amounts of data.\n",
    "- In **2006**, Yahoo open-sourced **Apache Hadoop**, inspired by Google’s paper. This was a major shift — suddenly, even small companies could work with massive datasets.\n",
    "- Around the same time, **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** launched services like **EC2**, **S3**, and **DynamoDB**, making cloud computing accessible to everyone.\n",
