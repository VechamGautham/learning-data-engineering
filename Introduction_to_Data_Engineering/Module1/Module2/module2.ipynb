    "  - Ingest user signup logs from the website.\n",
    "  - Transform the data (extract city names, dates, counts).\n",
    "  - Store in a clean reporting table.\n",
    "  - Serve it via a BI dashboard (e.g., Tableau or Looker).\n",

    "### 2. Operational Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: An e-commerce website wants to **track orders per minute** to detect site crashes or slowdowns.\n",
