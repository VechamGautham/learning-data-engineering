    "\n",
    "Enterprise Architecture is the design of systems to support **change** in an enterprise — achieved by **flexible and reversible decisions** through careful evaluation of trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It consists of **4 core components**:\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. 🧩 Business Architecture  \n",
    "**Purpose:** Defines the **product or service strategy** and **business model** of the enterprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "An e-commerce company wants:\n",
    "- 1-day delivery\n",
    "- Personalized product recommendations\n",
    "- Expansion to new regions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Engineer's Role:**  \n",
    "You need to understand these goals and build pipelines to track:\n",
    "- Order delivery times  \n",
    "- Customer behavior  \n",
    "- Sales by region\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. 🏗 Application Architecture  \n",
    "**Purpose:** Describes the **structure and interaction** of key applications that serve business needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "Flipkart might use:\n",
    "- Login Service  \n",

    "**Purpose:** Defines the **software and hardware** infrastructure (cloud, compute, network, tools).\n",

    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- AWS EC2 for compute  \n",
    "- S3 for storage  \n",

    "> **\"Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.\"**  \n",
    "> — Melvin Conway\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 What It Means\n",
    "\n",
    "Conway's Law suggests that the way teams **communicate and organize internally** will directly influence the **structure of the systems** they build.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your company has separate departments that rarely collaborate (like Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Operations), each team may create their own isolated data systems — leading to **siloed architectures**.\n",

    "📉 **Siloed Teams = Siloed Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Siloed Systems](./images/conway_law_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "But if the same departments work in a **collaborative, cross-functional** way — communicating frequently — the systems they build will be **more integrated and unified**.\n",
    "\n",
    "📈 **Collaborative Teams = Unified Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Unified System](./images/conway_law_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧑‍💻 Why It Matters to You as a Data Engineer\n",
    "\n",
    "Before designing a data architecture, **understand how your company communicates**:\n",
    "- Are teams siloed or cross-functional?\n",
    "- Do they share common goals or work in isolation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if your architecture looks perfect on paper, if it **clashes with your org's communication structure**, it’s likely to fail in practice.\n",
