    "1. **Client Application** connects to Redshift using JDBC/ODBC.  \n",

    "3. The **Leader Node distributes code** to slices on compute nodes.  \n",
    "4. Each slice **processes its portion of data** in parallel.  \n",

    "6. The leader node **aggregates the results** and sends the final answer back to the client.\n",
